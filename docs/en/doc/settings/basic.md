# Basic Settings

This page describes commonly used settings in SecScore and recommended defaults for stable classroom use.

## Theme & Appearance

- Supports light/dark theme
- If UI elements look abnormal, try switching theme or restarting the app

## Permissions & Passwords

SecScore provides three permission states:

- Admin: full access (students, reasons, settlement, data management)
- Score: scoring-related operations only
- Read-only: view only, no modifications

Recommendations:

- Set a strong password for Admin to prevent unintended changes
- If multiple people operate scoring, use a separate Score password to reduce risk

## Data Management (Import/Export)

- Export: back up JSON before major changes
- Import: use for migration or recovery; keep a copy of current data before importing

## Logs

- View logs: diagnose startup/crash or “operation not applied”
- Export logs: include logs + version when reporting issues
- Clear logs: optional cleanup after issues are resolved

## Suggested Workflow

1. Set passwords and permissions first
2. Import student roster and maintain groups
3. Maintain reason presets for faster scoring
4. Export JSON backups regularly
