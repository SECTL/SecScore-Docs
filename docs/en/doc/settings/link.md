> Reasons are presets that combine category, note, and default points. In scoring, you can pick a preset to fill inputs instantly and keep rules consistent.

## What a Reason Preset Contains

- **Category**: Homework, Discipline, Participation, Rewards, etc.
- **Reason / Note**: e.g. “Homework submitted on time”, “Late arrival”
- **Default points**: e.g. +1, +2, -1, -2

## Create & Manage

- **Add**: choose category, enter note, set default points
- **Edit**: adjust when your classroom rules change
- **Delete**: deleting a preset does not modify historical records, but it can’t be used for quick fill anymore

## Works With Scoring

- In [Scoring](./pick.md), selecting a preset fills the note and points automatically
- You can still adjust the note or points for edge cases

## Tips

- Start with 10–20 common presets, then expand as needed
- Keep categories simple so you can find them quickly during class
