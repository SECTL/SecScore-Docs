> **External Links & Integrations**
>
> SecScore currently focuses on a local workflow: roster → scoring → leaderboard → settlement. Schedule integration and external triggers may be added in future versions.

## Current Scope

- In-app navigation between roster/scoring/leaderboard/history
- Data migration and backup via JSON import/export

## Planned Directions (Not Guaranteed)

- Schedule-based switching (auto select class/stage by timetable)
- External notifications and integrations with teaching tools

If you need integration features, please describe your scenario via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SECTL/SecScore/issues).
