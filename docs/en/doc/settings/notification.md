> Leaderboard summarizes score changes by time range and supports exporting to a spreadsheet for review and sharing.

## Time Range

Depending on your app version, leaderboard commonly supports:

- **Today**: quick in-class feedback
- **This Week**: weekly review
- **This Month**: monthly evaluation / stage statistics

## Browse & Drill-down

- **Select class** first if you manage multiple rosters
- **Sorting** is usually by points (high → low)
- **Student details**: open a student to review their operation history

## Export (XLSX)

- Double-check the selected class and time range before exporting
- If you plan to settle a stage, export a copy before settlement for archiving

## Tips

- Daily operations are in [Scoring](./pick.md); maintain common presets in [Reasons](./link.md)
- For stage reset and history, go to [Settlement](./history.md)
