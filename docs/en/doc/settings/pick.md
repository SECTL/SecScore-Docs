> **Record every add/subtract operation**

> Use the simple flow “Select student → Choose a reason / write note → Enter points → Confirm” to keep scoring consistent and traceable.

## Scoring Flow

1. Select the current class (if you manage multiple rosters)
2. Select the target student
3. Choose Add or Subtract
4. Pick a reason preset (optional) or type a note manually
5. Enter points and confirm

## Add & Subtract

- **Add**: rewards, participation, good behavior, etc.
- **Subtract**: discipline, homework, late arrival, etc.
- **Tip**: keep point granularity consistent (e.g., 1 / 2 / 5) for cleaner statistics

## Reason Presets (Quick Fill)

- Selecting a preset fills the note and default points automatically
- Organize presets by category (Homework / Discipline / Participation / Rewards) for faster lookup

## Records & Undo

- **Browse records**: review recent operations for quick checking
- **Undo latest record**: revert the most recent operation and roll back points automatically

## Tips

- Set up common reason presets first in [Reasons](./link.md)
- Export JSON backup before settlement, then settle the stage in [Settlement](./history.md)
- For exporting rankings, go to [Leaderboard](./notification.md)
