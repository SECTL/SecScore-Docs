# Permissions & Unlocking

SecScore protects key operations with permission states and passwords to prevent unintended changes.

## Permission Model

- Admin: full access (students, reasons, settlement, data management)
- Score: scoring operations only (add/subtract, undo, etc.)
- Read-only: view only (leaderboard and history)

## How to Unlock

Check the current permission status in the top-right corner:

- If you see Read-only or Score, click “Enter Password” to unlock higher permissions
- For roster changes, settlement, or data import/export, make sure you are in Admin

## Password Tips

- Admin password should protect structural operations (roster, reasons, settlement, import/export)
- Score password can protect daily scoring when multiple people operate the app

## Recovery String

If password protection is enabled, keep the recovery string/information provided by the app. If you forget the password, you can recover following the in-app instructions.

## Recommended First-time Steps

1. Set Admin/Score passwords if needed
2. Import the student roster and verify the name column
3. Create reason presets for faster scoring
4. Start daily scoring and use Undo when necessary
5. Settle and archive by stage, and export JSON backups regularly
