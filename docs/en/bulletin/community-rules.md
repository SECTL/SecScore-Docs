# Community Rules

> These rules apply to all projects under the SECTL organization and related communities.

Welcome to the SECTL organization community! To ensure a good communication environment, please abide by the following rules when communicating.

## 🚫 Prohibited Behaviors

When communicating in the community, please comply with relevant laws and regulations, and **strictly prohibit** posting the following content:

1.  **Illegal and违规**: Sensitive or illegal content such as pornography, gambling, drugs, terrorism, violence, politics, etc.
2.  **Malicious content**: Viruses, trojans, cheats, and other malicious software or links.
3.  **Advertising promotion**: Commercial advertisements or promotional information without permission.
4.  **Disrupting order**: Behaviors that interfere with normal communication such as flooding, malicious repeating, frequently harassing others, etc.
5.  **Improper speech**: Personal attacks, insults, flame-baiting, and other remarks that destroy the community atmosphere.

## 💡 Questions and Requests for Help

To solve your problems more efficiently, please follow the suggestions below before asking questions:

1.  **Try self-check first**: Consult the [official documentation](/doc/guide/start.html), frequently asked questions, or use search engines.
2.  **Provide detailed information**:
    *   **Environment Information**: Operating system version, software version.
    *   **Problem Description**: What happened, how to reproduce (steps).
    *   **Diagnostic Information**: Provide error screenshots, screen recordings, or program logs.
3.  **Maintain proper attitude**: Please be polite when asking questions, and follow [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](https://github.com/ryanhanwu/How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way/blob/main/README-zh_CN.md).

> ❌ **Wrong Example**: "What should I do if the software won't open?" (no information)
>
> ✅ **Correct Example**: "I am using SecScore v1.0.0 on Windows 11, and it doesn't respond after clicking launch. Here is my error log screenshot..."

## ⚖️ Violation Handling

Those who violate the above regulations will have the following measures taken by administrators depending on the severity of the offense:
*   Verbal warning / withdrawal of violation content
*   Mute processing (24 hours - 30 days)
*   Permanent removal from group / blacklisting

We all hope to maintain a friendly and mutually helpful community environment!
